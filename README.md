# Lobaro CoAP GoLang adapter

[Lobaro CoAP](https://gitlab.com/lobaro/lobaro-coap) provides a highly portable CoAP stack for Client and Server.

The **GoLang adapter** uses cgo to provide a go based CoAP stack based on the code of Lobaro CoAP. It can be used for **testing the stack on a PC** and to write go based **server applications** that can handle CoAP connections.
